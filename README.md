# HOMM3Clone

This is an old HTML 5 clone of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 I attempted to build. It was suppose to go further and have MMO support.

Has some interesting code examples for handling web socket traffic, A* path finding, Canvas rendering, Collision Detection and other game related stuff.

Probably won't run as it was built on an ancient version of Node.js
